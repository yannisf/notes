# H2

H2 is a lightweight database that supports in-memory, embedded, and server modes.

## Server

This versatile mode starts an H2 instance and allows
databases to be created on demand upon connection, making it very useful for
 development purposes.

### Start an instance

    java -cp h2.jar org.h2.tools.Server -tcp -tcpAllowOthers

TIP: An h2.jar might already be available in the local maven repository

### Connect
To connect simply use the following parameters:

* JDBC driver: `org.h2.Driver`
* JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/./mydb`

The above JDBC url will initialize a database named mydb in the directory where
H2 was started from. The database will show up in the filesystem as `mydb.mv.db`.
