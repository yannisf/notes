== SchemaSpy

SchemaSpy is a tool to generate database schema reports.

=== Prerequisites
* JDBC driver for the database
* http://graphviz.org/[Graphviz] (the dot executable should be in path)
* http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/[SchemaSpy]

=== Report generations
Create a properties file to capture your database information.

.Sample file: orathin_ta.properties
----
extends=ora <1>
driverPath=ojdbc7.jar <2>
connectionSpec=jdbc:oracle:thin:@172.17.52.164:1521/TEXT_ANALYTICS <3>
----
<1> The database type you extend
<2> The JDBC driver path. Here, it is assumed that the driver exists in the same directory with the properties file.
<3> The JDBC url

.Execution
----
java -jar schemaSpy_5.0.0.jar -o ta -t orathin_ta.properties <1> -u TA_TEST -p TA_TEST -norows
----

Obviously:

* `java` should be in your path
* `schemaSpy_5.0.0.jar` is in the current directory
* *-o* defines the output directory
* *-u* the username to connect to the database
* *-p* the password to connect to the database
* *-norow* skip row information, and stick to bare schema
