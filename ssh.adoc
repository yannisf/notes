== SSH

=== Generate keys
Keys should be generated on your secure machine and not on the machine you intend to install the public key on.

----
# mkdir ~/.ssh
# chmod 700 ~/.ssh
# ssh-keygen -t rsa
----

The private key should remain safe and secure on your client. The public key should be moved to the `.ssh` directory of the remote server accounts you want to log in using key authentication. The public key should be registered to the servers:

----
# cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
----

=== Execute command on remote system

----
# ssh remote_system "command"
----
