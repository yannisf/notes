# Statistics

## Statistical hypothesis

A statistical hypothesis is a hypothesis that is testable on the basis of observing a process that is modeled via a set of random variables.

## Null hypothesis

In inferential statistics, the null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is nothing new happening, like there is no association among groups, or no relationship between two measured phenomena.

## Statistical significance

In statistical hypothesis testing, a result has statistical significance when it is very unlikely to have occurred given the null hypothesis. More precisely, a study's defined significance level, denoted α, is the probability of the study rejecting the null hypothesis, given that the null hypothesis were assumed to be true; and the p-value of a result, p, is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme, given that the null hypothesis were true. The result is statistically significant, by the standards of the study, when p ≤ α.

## p-value

In statistical hypothesis testing, the p-value or probability value is, for a given statistical model, the probability that, when the null hypothesis is true, the statistical summary (such as the sample mean difference between two groups) would be equal to, or more extreme than, the actual observed results.

## Confidence interval

From a population of N choose a sample of n. Τypically, the mean of the population will be different from the mean of your sample. But you would like to have some confidence on how accurate is the mean you have calculated from your sample. E.g. you would like to know that if you selected a new sample and calculated its mean, what is the interval within which you will find the mean 95% of the time. There is nothing magic with 95%. It could be 90% or 99%. A bigger percentage suggests a bigger confidence interval, since in order to be more sure that the mean of the sample will be within a specific interval, the interval will have to be wider.
