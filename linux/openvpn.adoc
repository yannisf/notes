== OpenVPN

=== Installation
. apt-get install openvpn
. From the server run:
+
----
# openvpn --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.9.8.1 10.9.8.2
----
. From the client run
+
----
openvpn --remote SERVER_IP --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.9.8.2 10.9.8.1
----

It should work!

=== systemd
From Debian Jessie and onwards, systemd is used to initialize the system. In order to start the `tun0` configuration, you should:
----
systemctl start openvpn@tun0.service
----

After that, there is a configuration file in `/etc/default/openvpn` where the server configurations can be managed.
