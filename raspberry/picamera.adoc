== PI Camera
The *PI Camera* is a small hardware module that can be hooked on a Raspberry PI

=== Streaming video
Using the PI Camera, video can be streamed from the camera to another system through the network.

.On the Raspberry PI
----
$ raspivid -t 0 -w 1280 -h 720 -rot 180 -fps 24 -o - | nc 192.168.1.3 9898
----

* *-t 0* : stream indefinetily
* *-w 1280* : width of the video will be 1280
* *-h 720* : height of the video will be 720
* *-fps* : frames per second
* *-o -* : output to stdout (don't miss the -)

The standard output of Raspberry PI pipes its output to netcat, which in this case establishes a connection to _192.168.1.1.3_ on port 9898

.On the linux host
The Linux host must have installed *mplayer* and *netcat* in order to receive and decode the video.
----
$ nc -l 9898 | mplayer -fps 24 -demuxer h264es -
----

* *-l 9898*: listen on port 9898
* *-fps 24*: frames per second
* *-demuxer h264es* : demux using h264es
* *-* : input should be standard input
